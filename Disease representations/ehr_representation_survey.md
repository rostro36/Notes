# [Deep Representation Learning of Patient Data from Electronic Health Records (EHR): A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02809)
## General results
From 2015 to 2019, the amount of paper almost doubles every year.
RNNs were the dominant model and the most common application and evaluation was on disease prediction. In 28 of the 49 closer inspected papers, the dataset was private.
## Learning scenarios
The majority (30) of all (49) the studies were supervised approaches, 11 were unsupervised, 8 were self-supervised.
## Evaluation tasks

"The existing predictive models mainly focus on the prediction of single diseases, rather than considering the complex mechanisms of patients from a holistic review."
